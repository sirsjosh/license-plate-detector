![License Plate Detection](path/to/your/app/screenshot.png)

## Overview

This project is a License Plate Detection App that utilizes YOLOv8 to detect license plates in images. The model is trained on annotated images, and the dataset is sourced from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/license-plate-recognition-rxg4e/dataset/4). Please note that the images are from the United Kingdom, and the model is specifically designed to detect license plates from the UK.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection:** The app is capable of accurately detecting license plates in images.
- **United Kingdom Specific:** The model is trained to recognize license plates from the United Kingdom.

## Dataset

The training dataset used for this project is sourced from Roboflow Universe. It consists of annotated images for training the YOLOv8 model. The dataset is specific to license plate recognition in the United Kingdom.

## Getting Started
